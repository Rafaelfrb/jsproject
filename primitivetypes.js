//Primitive types:
// String
// Numbers
// Booleans
// Undefined
// Null

let name = 'Rafael'; //String literal
let age = 32; //Number Literal
let isApproved = true; //Boolean Literal
let firstName = undefined;

//JavaScript is dynamically typed which means that a variable type can be changed during the 
// execution of the program. If we use => typeof name - the result would be string
// if we reasign the variable to 1 and use typeof name again it will result in number

name = 1;
